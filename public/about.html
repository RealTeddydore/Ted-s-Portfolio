<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello World, my name is Ted! Currently I live in Vietnam with my wife as we prepare for our move to back to America.
  International living has added color to my life and perspective. 
  Integrating in culture, food, art, and something as simple as transportation has been eye-opening!</p>
